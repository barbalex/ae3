-- rco_of_object enables joining rcos to objects while considering synonyms but prioritizing the original object
-- 1. if own rco exists, it is listed
-- 2. if no own rco exists but for a synonym: rco of synonym is listed (no priorisation if multiple exist)
-- 3. no rco > no row?
-- This would have to be updated after every update of rcos, synonyms (and objects?)
