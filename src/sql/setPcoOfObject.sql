-- pco_of_object enables joining pcos to objects while considering synonyms but prioritizing the original object
-- 1. if own pco exists, it is listed
-- 2. if no own pco exists but for a synonym: pco of synonym is listed (no priorisation if multiple exist)
-- 3. no pco > no row?
-- This would have to be updated after every update of pcos, synonyms (and objects?)
