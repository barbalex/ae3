/**
 * this query is currently not in use
 * would be a very nice way to fetch data for the tree:
 * filter by passing activeNodeArray
 *
 * data for users and organizations could be added
 *
 * ISSUE: if used as view policies would not be respected :-(
 * see: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-createpolicy.html
 * "This does not change how views work, however. As with normal queries and views, 
 * permission checks and policies for the tables which are referenced by a view will 
 * use the view owner's rights and any policies which apply to the view owner"
 *
 * maybe it could be used as a function returning a set of a type (to be created)
 * would that respect policies?
 * Seems that yes: functions have SECURITY INVOKER set by default
 * see postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html
 *
 * TODO: how return exactly what is shown? (openNodes)
 * needs to be queried with help of activeUrl:
 * - break activeUrl up into parent levels
 * - filter: 
 *   - this object's url equals activeUrl 
 *   - or: this object's url minus last element equals any of activeUrl's parents 
 *
